# scipp-neutron
Neutron scattering toolkit built using [scipp](https://github.com/scipp/scipp) for Data Reduction. Not facility or instrument specific.

This supersedes scripts in [ess-legacy](https://github.com/scipp/ess-legacy)

This serves facility and instrument specific functionality such as that available in [ess] (https://github.com/scipp/ess)

# Branch organisation

Developments `master` are pinned to the latest [stable release](https://github.com/scipp/scipp/tags) of scipp. Other ongoing feature developments should be merged into `latest`.
