Overview: scippneutron
======================

``scippneutron`` builds on top of the core ``scipp`` package and provides features specific to handling data generated in neutron scattering facilities.
A key example is "unit conversion", e.g., from time-of-flight to energy transfer in an inelastic neutron scattering experiment at a spallation-based neutron source.

Beamline geometry
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Note that ``theta`` or ``scattering_angle`` are deliberately not supported, due to some ambiguity on how the terms are used in the community, and possible confusion of ``theta`` (from Bagg's law) with ``theta`` in spherical coordinates.
